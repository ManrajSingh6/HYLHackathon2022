HYL Hackathon 2022
Authors: Manraj Singh and Sajan Hayer

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive way to teach students about some basic concepts of computer science.
We have chosen to teach students about Variables in Java through a series of notes, videos and interactive quizzes.

Before compiling the program, you all of the following files must be located in the same folder in a directory of your choice:
-Login.java
-Main.java
-Quiz.java
-Lesson1.java
-Lesson2.java
-Interface.java

Once all of the files are in the appropriate directory and you have changed your command-line terminal
to the correct directory, compile the program using the following command:

javac Login.java

After the code has compiled, please run the program with the following command:

java Login.java

This will open a login page where you can enter the following credentials to login (temporary credentials):

username: demo
password: HYL2022

You may need to remove the package statement at the top of each file in order to sucessfully compile and run the program
if your files are located in a different package/directory.
